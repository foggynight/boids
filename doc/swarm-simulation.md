boids: Swarm Simulation
=======================

Introduction
------------

This project aims to simulate the swarming behaviour of birds and other
flocks, herds, and schools of animals. The term boid is a play on words,
referring to 'bird-oid' objects which act together as a swarm.


Factors Affecting Boid Behaviour
--------------------------------

The behaviour of a boid in this context is in relation to its motion.
There are three factors which affect the steering and velocity of a
boid:

- **Alignment**
- **Cohesion**
- **Separation**
